Seven people were taken to hospitals after the explosion, and three of them remained in critical condition Monday morning, Mike Guillot, the director of emergency medical services at East Jefferson General Hospital, said at a news conference. The other four were released. Sheriff Joe Lopinto of Jefferson Parish said at the news conference, We are fairly confident there is an eighth person, adding that search efforts were continuing, and the Coast Guard had contacted the family of the person. No fatalities had been reported as of Monday morning. The blast occurred shortly after seven pm near St Charles Parish and the city of Kenner. The platform is in unincorporated Jefferson Parish. Officials are still investigating the cause of the explosion, but the City of Kenner said on its Facebook page that authorities on the scene report that cleaning chemicals ignited on the surface of the oil rig platform.\"\"\"\n","print(article)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vJ8_0aJ06Iss","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"3l2wDhRh6Isu","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"h0rdyQoF6Isx","colab_type":"text"},"source":["So, in this case, we have the input being the string variable that contains the text, and the output is a number."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"k9Pu1kho6Isx","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"zqKgIQvG6Isy","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FaurVkxY6Isz","colab_type":"text"},"source":["---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XH7Uu_7a6Is0","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Exercise 8: Check if a number is within a range\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zhM_m6PD6Is1","colab_type":"text"},"source":["\n","Write a function `in_range` that checks if a number `n` is within a given range `(a ... b)` (inclusive on both ends) and returns `True` or `False`.
