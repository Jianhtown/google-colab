While mastering the syntax of the regular expression language does require climbing a learning curve, this learning curve is not particularly steep, and a newcomer can find herself performing useful tasks with regular expressions almost immediately. Efforts spent learning regular expressions quickly pay off--tasks that are well suited for regular expressions abound.
