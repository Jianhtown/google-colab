Many supporters of Bernie Sanders, who lost the state’s Democratic primary this spring by 12 points, say they might not vote at all.\n","-- Trying to re-activate the coalition that allowed him to carry the state twice, Barack Obama will travel to Philadelphia today for a big downtown rally on Clinton’s behalf. Elizabeth Warren spoke to college students at Penn last Friday, and Sanders is coming to Carnegie Mellon this Friday. Bill Clinton spoke to a predominantly black audience here last week.\n","-- While Hillary maintains a lead, and is favored to ultimately carry the state, everyone acknowledges that the race has tightened here over the past month even more than it has nationally. A Quinnipiac poll last week put Clinton up 5 points, down from 10 points a few weeks before. A Franklin and Marshall College poll published the week before had her up 7 points, but the percentage viewing her favorably had dropped to 38 percent from 47 percent in July.\n","-- Many analysts believe turnout will be lower in 2016 than in 2012 or 2008. That would help Trump and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. Less important than the percentage of support Clinton pulls among young people and minorities is the number of total votes she gets from these constituencies. In the past two presidential elections, for example, Obama won in Philly proper by more than half a million votes – creating an almost insurmountable advantage that Romney’s strength elsewhere could not match.\n","In 2012, as a point of reference, 5.8 million ballots were cast. “I don’t know how we get there,” said James Lee, who runs Susquehanna Polling and Research, a Republican-aligned firm that does survey work for several media outlets. “The closer you get to 5 million, the better for Trump. We know who is not turning out: the college students and the minorities. That’s polling 101.”\n","Trump speaks last night at U.S. Cellular Center in Asheville, North Carolina. (Brian Blanco/Getty Images)\n","-- Anecdotally, there are many reasons for Democrats to worry about a lack of enthusiasm.\n","Take Jared Ault of Pittsburgh, who supported Sanders in the primary and has not decided what to do in November. He said two of his brothers are certain they will not vote. Neither will his aunt, and five of his friends at work have told him they plan to stay home.\n","“It’s probably the most difficult election we’ve had in recent years, probably since the 1950s. I really think we’re going to see the lowest turnout in my lifetime,” Ault said. “Both are just so divisive. Clinton has so many skeletons in her closet, and I honestly believe Trump is a sociopath. … Hillary has her hands in the pockets of a lot of the major corporations, and that’s why they support her. I’m just thoroughly disgusted by the way this election has gone.”\n","The 30-year-old banking consultant, with a two-year-old in a stroller and another baby on the way, cast his first vote for George W. Bush but has steadily become more liberal since then. He was one of a few Democratic-leaning folks I met at a Pirates baseball game who are torn about whether to get behind Clinton, support someone like Jill Stein or Gary Johnson or just not bother with figuring it out. Ultimately, Ault allowed, he might vote for Clinton if he concluded that Trump would become president if he did not. But someone needs to convince him\n","John Fetterman announces his candidacy for U.S. Senate last September. (Keith Srakocic/AP)\n","-- David Plouffe, who managed Obama’s 2008 campaign, has repeatedly said that Pennsylvania is not a true battleground and advises Democrats against spending too much there.\n","“I don’t share David Plouffe’s supreme confidence that Pennsylvania is guaranteed to be blue,” responds Braddock Mayor John Fetterman, a Bernie supporter who ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for Senate this year. “Without a doubt, it is one that’s going to be close. The Democrats have to continue to make a case. If Democrats keep their head down and stay focused, we can. It’s not a sure thing, and we can’t take any vote for granted. That’s for sure.”\n","Fetterman is hosting the Sanders rally in Pittsburgh this Friday, and he’s been campaigning for Katie McGinty, who beat him in the Democratic primary and now faces Toomey. “In my case, I tell people, ‘Look I ran as the most progressive voice in my campaign and I came up short. Democrats have to come together,’” he said in an interview. “Once again, I remain convinced that the biggest driving force toward unity is the prospect of Donald Trump.”\n","-- After Trump telegraphed that his theory of the case hinged on Pennsylvania, Democrats siphoned additional resources to the state. Operatives say the nuts-and-bolts of their field program in 2016 is much stronger than in 2012, especially with the top-tier Senate race.\n","“I’m really not the eternal optimist. I’m the guy that urges caution. And I do today,” said T.J. Rooney, a former chairman of the state Democratic Party. “But I do so with an appreciation of how much better the ground operation is here this cycle than it’s ever been. What gives me comfort, or solace, is the understanding that all the things that can possibly be done to communicate with these men and women are being done.”\n","He thinks Obama coming to Philly today will make a difference. “He reminds people of what’s at stake and what we need to do,” said Rooney. “You can do events with this president, and you can see almost overnight the tangible result of his visit.”\n","-- The Keystone State is already drawing vastly more attention and money than four years ago, when Mitt Romney stayed away until the 11th hour and then lost by 5.5 points.\n","George W. Bush campaigns in the Rust Belt in 2004. (Stephen Jaffe/AFP/Getty Images)\n","-- But a generation of GOP operatives has experienced the quadrennial temptations of the Pennsylvania Siren Song, and many feel like Trump’s big play is a fool’s errand. George H.W. Bush in 1988 was the last Republican to carry the state. George W. Bush tried very hard and still lost Pennsylvania by 144,000 votes in 2004 – the closest margin since then.\n","“Even when Republicans get close, they never really get over the finish line,” said Lee, who runs the GOP-aligned polling firm. “The problem is that in the polling four years ago, when Obama had a slight lead or Romney was within the margin of error, most of the undecided were Democrats. People usually break toward their party in the final days.”\n","-- When you do the math, Trump has a narrow path to victory:\n","He’s over-performing Romney in rural areas but under-performing him in the suburbs, and there are more voters in the latter. “The four suburban Philadelphia counties are the lynchpin to carrying the state,” said Terry Madonna, who conducts the Franklin & Marshall College Poll. Obama carried all four in 2008 and got three of them in 2012. Right now, Trump is trailing in the double digits in these areas and would lose all four.\n","Hillary campaigns in West Philadelphia last month. (Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images)\n","Democrats, with a registration advantage of 919,000, also simply have more potential voters. Steven Yaccino and Sasha Issenberg dive into the voter file for a numbers-heavy piece on Bloomberg this morning: “(The party) can count on a base of nearly 1.69 million votes, and—thanks in part to overwhelming support from African-Americans in Philadelphia—another 1.37 million less-reliable voters who can be mobilized through get-out-the-vote work. If Clinton manages to turn out all of the Democratic base and get out the vote targets, she would have more than 3 million votes in her pocket without having to win over a single persuadable voter. And Trump could run a perfect ground game, miraculously turn out all his Republican targets, win every expected persuadable vote cast—projected to be around 187,000—and still lose.”\n","“That means that the difference between a battleground and a blowout in Pennsylvania is whether Trump can peel off Democrats,” Steven and Sasha add. “The most obvious targets are the some 300,000 white blue-collar men living in areas most affected by shuttered plants. If, say, Trump were able to lure this entire group, it would be enough to flip Democrats’ 556,000-voter lead to an ever-so-slight 21,000 Republican advantage.”\n","-- Analyzing voter registration data, the Philadelphia Inquirer argues that The Trump Effect is being overstated and that he’s not drawing new as many new voters into the process as his campaign claims: “Some 129,000 new Pennsylvania voters have joined the GOP since November. But Democrats, aided by a heated primary between Clinton and Sanders, have added 172,000 … In a separate tally, a sizable 39,000 more voters converted to Republican than switched to Democrat this year -- part of a trend of party defections that began in 1988. … Of the Republican voters (in Bucks County) who skipped at least the last three presidential elections, only 3 percent showed up for this year's primary.”\n","-- But Pennsylvania is a big prize, and Trump is coming back this week. If he can find a way to get the state’s 20 electoral votes, several additional routes to 270 open. He could afford to lose another, smaller battleground, including Virginia (13), North Carolina (15), Nevada (6), New Hampshire (4) or Iowa (6).\n","Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning newsletter.\n","With contributions from Elise Viebeck (@eliseviebeck).\n","Sign up to receive the newsletter.\n","WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n","-- U.S. News's 2017 college rankings posted at midnight. “Among this year’s novelties, the University of Chicago placed third on the national university list, tied with Yale, just behind Harvard and up from ninth as recently as six years ago,” Nick Anderson flags. “Wellesley, previously fourth among liberal arts colleges, moved up to third, switching places with Swarthmore.” See the full list here.\n","-- The NCAA announced it will pull all 2016-17 championship events out of North Carolina to retaliate against the state’s so-called “bathroom bill.\" A spokesman for the Republican Party responded: “I wish the NCAA was this concerned about the women who were raped at Baylor.\" (Des Bieler)\n","-- The Clinton campaign said it will release additional medical records this week, seeking to put to rest lingering concerns over her health after Sunday’s incident, and Hillary herself called into CNN last night to talk about her pneumonia. “I didn’t think it was going to be that big a deal,\" she said. “Obviously I should have gotten some rest sooner,\" she told Anderson Cooper. \"It's just the kind of thing that if it happens to you and you're a busy, active person, you keep moving forward.” (Abby Phillip and Anne Gearan)\n","Scuffles break out at Trump's Asheville rally Embed Share Play Video3:07\n","Pushing, grabbing, punching and obscene gesturing broke out between Donald Trump supporters and protesters at the Republican presidential nominee's rally in Asheville, N.C., on Sept. 12.

Gary Palmer said he has “serious doubts” as to whether Clinton has pneumonia: “I mean … just my observation, if it were pneumonia, I would’ve thought they would’ve come out and said that very early on,” the Alabama lawmaker said. Palmer went on to reference Clinton’s recent coughing spells: “They’ve tried to attribute the cough to bronchitis, they’ve tried to attribute it to pneumonia, but I sat in the Benghazi hearing for three hours,” he said. “And she sat there and coughed her way through that. You know, again, you just look at the pattern and it just begs the question, are we being lied to again?” (Buzzfeed)\n","And Trump adviser Ben Carson called for Clinton to release results of a “specialized MRI,” continuing to make vague speculations about her overall health. “The fact that the security detail assisting her as she clumsily attempted to enter her vehicle … did not appear surprised as if dealing with something new,” Carson said of Clinton’s 9/11 departure. “[It] … makes one wonder if such awkward moments are something they have become accustomed to.” Carson’s comments come as a break with the Trump campaign, who has avoided discussion about Clinton’s health.

He’d had a serious heart attack in 1955, requiring extensive hospitalization. In contrast to his seeming senescence, his successor, John F. Kennedy, seemed vibrant and flamboyant. The reality was that …. Kennedy wasn't actually that vigorous, and indeed was secretly afflicted by serious medical problems, including Addison’s disease, that his aides concealed from the public. The history of the presidency includes a running thread of illness and incapacity, much of it hidden from the public out of political calculation. A stroke incapacitated Woodrow Wilson in 1919, for example, but the public had no inkling until many months later. And when Grover Cleveland needed surgery in 1893 to remove a cancerous tumor in his mouth, he did it secretly, on a friend's yacht cruising through Long Island Sound. The desire to keep their physical condition secret led many American presidents to avoid the best doctors, says historian Matthew Algeo.”\n","-- Both Clinton and Trump owe voters more specifics on their health, The Post’s editorial board writes. “Sen. John McCain, who was 71 when he ran for president … released nearly 1,200 pages of medical records. He did not do this to feed pure voyeurism. He did it so that voters could evaluate their comfort with the health of a septuagenarian applying for the toughest job in the world — in which there are no sick days and a slip of the tongue can become an international incident. Neither Ms. Clinton, who is 68, nor Mr. Trump have come close to this level of disclosure. Both need to do better.”\n","-- “It seems unlikely that [Trump] has familiarized himself with Susan Sontag’s ‘Illness as Metaphor,’ in which Sontag argued that illness is often perceived as a result of weak character traits,” NYT’s Susan Dominus writes. “But for weeks, Trump seemed to be working off some kind of Sontag-inspired playbook. Clinton was not just lacking in the physical stamina required to fight ISIS, he said, ‘but the mental stamina’; his team often spoke of her as ‘frail.’ In turning illness into a personality flaw, a dangerous side effect of femaleness, Trump most likely made it all the more difficult for Clinton to acknowledge straightaway whatever health issue was in fact troubling her, whenever it kicked in in earnest. … In the narrative of this particular, strange election cycle, Clinton’s moment of evident illness will surely come to symbolize something. What that is, exactly, depends on how crudely, how truthfully, campaigners on both sides manipulate or manage a subject that is both intimately personal and yet significant for the public.”\n","-- Bill Clinton will take his wife's place place at two Beverley Hill fundraisers today, headlining an event at the home of Seth MacFarlane -- which will feature a performance by Lionel Richie -- and a dinner hosted at the home of of Diane von Furstenberg and Barry Diller.

(The Washington Post)\n","THE DAILY DONALD:\n","-- Pot calls kettle black: Trump slammed Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment as \"the single biggest mistake of the political season\" and demanded she apologize to anyone she might have offended. From Jenna Johnson: \"Personally, when I heard it, I thought that it was not something that was within the realm of possible, that she would have said it,” he said on Fox News. \"And she actually did, and she even really doubled up, because it was said with such anger, such unbelievable anger. And I think this is the biggest mistake of the political season.\"\n","-- Clinton has expressed regret for saying that \"HALF\" of Trump's supporters were in the \"basket of deplorables\" but not for the underlying point. But as Trump’s campaign hones in on the comment, conservatives and progressives are growing further apart in their analysis of what was even said. From Dave Weigel: “In a conference call organized by the RNC, Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) insisted that Clinton was referring to some percentage of veterans. Bill Kristol, an anti-Trump conservative, also suggested that Clinton may have been insulting the troops. The argument, which is expected to be advanced by [Trump] … is not about the specifics of the gaffe. It is about the fact that Clinton could consider any voter ‘deplorable,’ and whether doing so reveals a snobbiness that is unbecoming (or, to use the buzzword of 2016, ‘disqualifying’) from a presidential candidate.”\n","-- Mike Pence refused to call former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke “deplorable” in a CNN interview -- highlighting the difficulty of taking a hardline stance against Clinton's remarks. When asked by host Wolf Blitzer if Duke and other white nationalists would fit into the “deplorable category,” Pence declined to respond directly. “I’m not really sure why the media keeps dropping David Duke’s name,” Pence replied. “He has denounced David Duke repeatedly.” “So you call him a deplorable?” Blizter pressed.“ No, I’m not in the name-calling business, Wolf,” Pence said. “You know me better than that.” (Philip Bump)\n","-- Making it worse: Duke then praised Pence for his remarks, saying he is “pleased” that the GOP vice presidential nominee declined to call him deplorable. “It’s good to see an individual like Pence and others start to reject this absolute controlled media,” Duke said. “The truth is the Republican Party is big tent. I served in the Republican caucus. I was in the Republican caucus in the legislature. I had a perfect Republican voting record. It’s ridiculous that they attack me because of my involvement in that nonviolent Klan four decades ago.” (Buzzfeed)\n","-- “The media’s criticism of Clinton’s claim has been matched in vehemence only by their allergy to exploring it,” Ta-Nehisi Coates complains in The Atlantic. “It is easy enough to look into Clinton’s claim and verify it or falsify it. … Consider the following: Had polling showed that relatively few Trump supporters believe black people are lazy and criminally-inclined, if only a tiny minority of Trump supporters believed that Muslims should be banned from the country … would journalists decline to point this out as they excoriated her? Of course not. But the case against Clinton’s 'basket of deplorables' is a triumph of style over substance, of clamorous white grievance over knowable facts. The safe space for the act of being white endures today. This weekend, the media … saw it challenged and—not for the first time—organized to preserve it. For speaking a truth, backed up by data, Clinton was accused of promoting bigotry. No. The true crime was endangering white consciousness.”\n","Janet Yellen, right, attends a Jackson Hole economic summit in Wyoming last month.

Doubting whether rates would change while Obama remains in office, Trump said: \"[Obama] wants to go out. He wants to play golf for the rest of this life.

But they refuse to offer any details or proof to back up the claim. “In all, The Post has identified less than $9 million in gifts to charity from Trump's pocket over his lifetime, including the $5.3 million he gave to his foundation before the last gift in 2008. In addition, Trump's foundation has taken in about $9 million from other donors, and given away most of it. Last year, the Trump campaign also put out a detailed list of what it said was $102 million in charitable giving from Trump over five years. But a close look by The Post found that not a single one of the gifts listed was actually a donation of Trump's own money.”\n","-- LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman said he will donate up to $5 million to veterans if Trump releases his tax returns before the final presidential debate.
